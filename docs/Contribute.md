### Code of Conduct

No COC, follow whatever works for you :) 

If you still reading and wondering why no COC, let's write down few edge cases(out of infinity)  

1) It's Open Source (no one cares!)

2) Not every person Mother Tongue is `English`, so actual meaning of what person wrote might be entirely different than what person intended to say.
 
3) Some people used to be more formal, their intention is not to hurt other but ..

4) Some people act like they are innocent,but in reality they just doing for the sake of fun.

5) Creating a new github(fake) account/borrowing someone else account is just a matter of seconds.

***If you think all this is nonsense, we should invest some time in framing rules and spend some time in teaching/applying the rules to other people, try spending that time in knowing [who you are](http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/who_am_I.pdf) or send a COC PR :)***
